MY LOVE FOR THE ROMAN EMPIRE IS UNDENIABLY GREATER THAN FOR MYSELF.
THE GREATEST EMPIRE EVER TO HAVE EXISTED. I PLEDGE MY ETERNAL SERVITUDE AND I AM FOREVER BOUND TO SERVE IT, IN LIFE AND IN DEATH.
THEY HAVE MERELY GIVEN US: ROADS, CENTRAL HEATING, CONCRETE, THE CALENDAR, AND FLUSHING TOILETS AND SEWERS.
